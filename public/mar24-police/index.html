  "articleBody": " Area Overview / General Information Over March, crime reports have seen a decrease compared with February’s figures.\nIn other welcome news, there have been no housebreakings or commercial properties targeted over March and no violent crimes reported.\nI would however encourage persons with commercial properties in Broomhill to remain vigilant and ensure that all security measures are taken to prevent and deter persons from targeting premises with cash kept to a minimum within till floats and no other major items of value left within premises if possible, for example IPads etc.\nAs mentioned last month, we have seen a rise in youth disorder across the west end, in particular within Partick around Merkland Court and West End Retail Park. Shoplifting amongst these groups continues to remain an issue and we have identified a number of persons involved.\nHyndland Train station has also seen a rise in anti-social behaviour, and I would encourage local residents to report incidents of youths causing anti-social behaviour to police via 101 for non-emergencies and 999 for ongoing disturbances. I would also encourage anyone with a secure entry system to ensure that it is in working order and not to allow any persons in who are not obviously linked to the block as we have seen youths entering common close areas and antagonising homeowners. Police have been in the area engaging with these groups and dispersing them accordingly.\nPolice Scotland Bank Scam A number of reports have been received by Police Scotland in regard to telephone calls from criminals impersonating police officers in order to obtain money from victims. The criminal impersonating the police informs the victim that they have been subject to a fraud, and thereafter the criminal will attempt to get money from the victim. Police Scotland officers will never:\nAsk you to transfer money to another account Ask you to withdraw money and hand it to a person or post it by mail Exchange money into Euros or other foreign currency Ask for your PIN number Tell you that a new bank account has been set up for you to move money into Theft of Keyless Entry Cars As mentioned last month there continues to be issues with regards to the theft of vehicles that use keyless entry, mainly 4x4’s, with 1 report in Broomhill again this month. Reports have seen vehicles taken overnight from both driveways and the street, where offenders are using relay devices whilst standing outside a property to manipulate the signal from the keycards that are inside, before gaining access to the vehicles and driving off without the need for any keys. By placing your keycard inside a “Faraday” pouch, this prevents the offenders from picking up a signal and bypassing the security of the vehicle. Faraday boxes are also beneficial if you have several keys within your property and wish to house them in a secure way. Both are readily available from a number of retailers online.\n‘Ex-offender’ Cold Callers There have been a few incidents across the west end in recent months relating to cold callers as per the following scam.\nThe Scam There has recently been an increase across Scotland in reports of cold callers who say they are selling goods door-to-door as part of an ’ex-offender rehabilitation scheme’.\nIn some cases, the callers say they have just been released from prison or a young offenders institution and are selling goods to try and make some money before starting a college course. Others claim to be taking part in a Government scheme to help them obtain employment in sales.\nThey typically offer goods such as household cleaning products, gardening equipment or craft supplies. Some may ask for donations for ex-prisoners. If a householder does not have cash, the cold caller may provide bank account details so that they can transfer money.\nAlthough some of these cold callers show some form of ID card, they often don’t have a pedlar’s certificate or a licence from the police to allow them to sell door-to-door in the local area. The goods they offer are usually of poor quality and overpriced.\nHow to Avoid Never feel obliged to answer the door to a cold caller – it is your home and you should not let anyone in unless you feel comfortable.\nIf you do answer the door, verify that the person is genuine and take a note of the company’s details. ID cards can be faked – close the door and, rather than phoning the number on the ID card, look up the company’s number on their official website or in an official phone directory to check their identity. Legitimate callers will be happy to wait while you perform these checks.\nIf you feel uncomfortable or suspicious about a cold caller in your local area, phone Police Scotland on 101, or call 999 if you feel threatened.\nSign up for Neighbourhood Watch Scotland Alerts to stay up to date with what is going on in your community Find out more Police Scotland Trading Standards Scotland\nCrimes of Violence There were no crime reports raised for violence committed over March.\nCrimes of Dishonesty There was 1 crime report raised for dishonesty committed over March.\nCrimes Against Property There was 1 crime against property reported this month involving a vandalism.\nDrugs Use and Abuse There was 1 drug case reported this month.\nCommunity intelligence is key to detecting and preventing drug supply.
