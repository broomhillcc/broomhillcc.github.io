  "articleBody": "Statement to Broomhill Community Broomhill Community Council (BCC) has concerns about the Restricted Parking Zone (RPZ) proposed for Broomhill. BCC has previously submitted design plan feedback to Glasgow City Council (GCC) in 2024, some of which has been taken into account in the design plans. Having now had opportunity to consider the likely impact of the proposed RPZ, BCC cannot support the current proposals for the Broomhill area.\nFor the purposes of this response, BCC has restricted comment to headline issues likely to be relevant to the whole community. We are aware this is not a comprehensive list of specific comments or concerns from residents in Broomhill and encourage all residents to provide feedback to the ongoing community engagement survey and to our elected councillors.\nBCC response to GCC regarding the proposed RPZ Broomhill is a quiet residential area with a thriving primary school and a small number of independent businesses. Although bus and train links exist in the vicinity, these are not comparable to a city centre location, while available cycling infrastructure is mixed. As such, the current proposals for restricted parking will deter or restrict visitors to the area. As a predominantly residential area, we are concerned about the isolating effect this will have on residents of Broomhill, many of whom are elderly or have young families.\nThe parking restrictions will apply to those providing essential support networks to Broomhill residents: both formally (e.g. paid carers) and informally (unpaid carers, family and friends, charities). Older adults, young families and residents with health and/or mobility issues will be particularly vulnerable to restrictions on car parking. Glasgow City Council’s Family Equality Outcomes Action Plan 2025–2030 recognises loneliness as a priority issue.\nIn addition, the restrictions will impact many groups which meet in the area; we specifically note the parking restrictions will apply to staff at Broomhill Primary School, potentially undermining the essential work of Educational Services in Broomhill.\nWith these concerns, we would expect GCC to take a least-restrictive approach to the implementation of parking restrictions. However, the proposed charges and operational times for the Broomhill RPZ exceed what is justifiable for Broomhill and appear more suited to a city centre area.\nWe are aware that GCC Parking Services recently developed two standardised options for parking zones in Glasgow City. While a move to Option B* for the Broomhill RPZ would clearly be better suited to the area, this would still involve parking restrictions until 6pm and on Saturdays. The 3-hour maximum parking limit and proposed fee structure would also remain unchanged. We consider Option B to remain excessive for the Broomhill area.\nIf the intended purpose of the RPZ (for non-residents of the area) is to encourage use of alternative transport modes for commuters and work-related activities, this can be achieved with shorter daytime operational hours, Monday to Friday only, and without the 3-hour maximum stay.\nWe also understand the statutory power to charge for parking provided to GCC by the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 is lawful when used primarily to address issues like traffic congestion, not to raise revenue. We invite GCC to provide evidence that parking restrictions are justified by congestion concerns in Broomhill during evening and weekend times, or to amend the proposed operational times and limits to appropriately suit the Broomhill area.\nSpecifically, regarding resident’s visitor parking permits: we request GCC provides clearer clarification that these are available for purchase without limitations. As it stands, GCC intends to reserve the theoretical right to deny sale of visitor permits to residents. This is extraordinary power to claim over the lives of Broomhill residents, and it is remarkable that GCC has not recognised the seriousness of this. GCC must provide reassurance by explicitly detailing what circumstances could lead to denial of visitor permits, who this decision would reside with, and what route to appeal would exist.\nWe encourage GCC to ensure that the proposed RPZ does not undermine the work and priorities of other GCC departments. BCC is concerned that implementation of this RPZ is proposed despite a lack of available information regarding GCC’s overall parking strategy. There is little evidence that this RPZ has been proposed with a holistic view of our community and the people who live and work here.\nWithout clearer evidence that the RPZ will bring overall benefit to the Broomhill area as a whole (as opposed to a narrow focus on parking issues, many of which GCC can address through existing regulations), BCC cannot support the current proposals for an RPZ in Broomhill.\nParking Services Update to GCC, 25th November 2025, proposes two standardised options as follows: Option A Mon–Sun 8am–10pm and Option B Mon–Sat 8am–6pm.\n",
