  "articleBody": "Statement to Broomhill Community Broomhill Community Council (BCC) has concerns about the Restricted\nParking Zone (RPZ) proposed for Broomhill.\nBCC has previously submitted design plan feedback to Glasgow City\nCouncil (GCC) in 2024, some of which has been taken into account in\nthe design plans. Having now had opportunity to consider the likely impact of the proposed\nRPZ, BCC cannot support the current proposals for the Broomhill area.\nFor the purposes of this response, BCC has restricted comment to headline issues likely to be\nrelevant to the whole community. We are aware this is not a comprehensive list of specific\ncomments or concerns from residents in Broomhill and encourage all residents to provide\nfeedback to the ongoing community engagement survey and to our elected councillors.\nBCC response to GCC regarding the proposed RPZ Broomhill is a quiet residential area with a thriving primary school and a small number of\nindependent businesses. Although bus and train links exist in the vicinity, these are not\ncomparable to a city centre location, while available cycling infrastructure is mixed. As such,\nthe current proposals for restricted parking will deter or restrict visitors to the area. As a\npredominantly residential area, we are concerned about the isolating effect this will have on\nresidents of Broomhill, many of whom are elderly or have young families. The parking\nrestrictions will apply to those providing essential support networks to Broomhill residents:\nboth formally (e.g. paid carers) and informally (unpaid carers, family and friends, charities.)\nOlder adults, young families and residents with health and/or mobility issues will be\nparticularly vulnerable to restrictions on car parking. Glasgow City Council’s Family Equality\nOutcomes Action Plan 2025-2030 recognises loneliness as a priority issue. In addition, the\nrestrictions will impact many groups which meet in the area; we specifically note the parking\nrestrictions will apply to staff at Broomhill Primary School, potentially undermining the\nessential work of Educational Services in Broomhill.\nWith these concerns, we would expect GCC to take a least-restrictive approach to the\nimplementation of parking restrictions. However, the proposed charges and operational times\nfor the Broomhill RPZ exceed what is justifiable for Broomhill and appear more suited to a city\ncentre area.\nWe are aware that GCC Parking Services recently developed two standardised options for\nparking zones in Glasgow City. While a move to Option B* for the Broomhill RPZ would clearly\nbe better suited to the area, this would still involve parking restrictions until 6pm and on\nSaturdays. The 3-hour maximum parking limit and proposed fee structure would also remain\nunchanged. We consider Option B to remain excessive for the Broomhill area. If the intended\npurpose of the RPZ (for non-residents of the area) is to encourage use of alternative transport\nmodes for commuters and work-related activities, this can be achieved with shorter daytime\noperational hours, Monday to Friday only, and without the 3-hour maximum stay. We also\nunderstand the statutory power to charge for parking provided to GCC by the Road Traffic\nRegulation Act 1984 is lawful when used primarily to address issues like traffic congestion, not\nto raise revenue. We invite GCC to provide evidence that parking restrictions are justified by\ncongestion concerns in Broomhill during evening and weekend times, or to amend the\nproposed operational times and limits to appropriately suit the Broomhill area.\nSpecifically, regarding resident’s visitor parking permits: we request GCC provides clearer\nclarification that these are available for purchase without limitations. As it stands, GCC intends\nto reserve the theoretical right to deny sale of visitor permits to residents. This is\nextraordinary power to claim over the lives of Broomhill residents, and it is remarkable that\nGCC has not recognised the seriousness of this. GCC must provide reassurance by explicitly\ndetailing what circumstances could lead to denial of visitor permits, who this decision would\nreside with, and what route to appeal would exist.\nWe encourage GCC to ensure that the proposed RPZ does not undermine the work and\npriorities of other GCC departments. BCC is concerned that implementation of this RPZ is\nproposed despite a lack of available information regarding GCC’s overall parking strategy.\nThere is little evidence that this RPZ has been proposed with a holistic view of our community\nand the people who live and work here. Without clearer evidence that the RPZ will bring\noverall benefit to the Broomhill area as a whole (as opposed to a narrow focus on parking\nissues, many of which GCC can address through existing regulations), BCC cannot support the\ncurrent proposals for an RPZ in Broomhill.\n* Parking Services Update to GCC, 25th November 2025, proposes two standardised options as\nfollows: Option A Mon – Sun 8am – 10pm and Option B Mon – Sat 8am – 6pm.\n",
