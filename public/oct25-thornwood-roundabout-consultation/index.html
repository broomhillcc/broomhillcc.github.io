While the roundabout sits at the southern extent of the Broomhill Community Council area, it is a key gateway for our residents and was highlighted in our Local Place Plan as important for everyday journeys.\nüëâ Have your say: https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/thornwood\nWhat‚Äôs proposed Safer crossings: Signalised crossings where feasible and step-free, accessible crossings on approaches from Whiteinch, Broomhill, Thornwood, and Glasgow Harbour. Bus stop safety on Dumbarton Road (Thornwood): Designs prioritise safe crossings between bus stops. School routes: Step-free access at Auchentorlie Street and Thornwood Avenue, improving safety on routes to Thornwood Primary School. National Cycle Network link: A segregated cycle lane from the Riverside Museum to Smith Street / Dilwara Street (Whiteinch), strengthening connections between West Glasgow, the City Centre, and the Govan‚ÄìPartick bridge. We‚Äôve been overdue improvements to walking, wheeling and cycling in this corridor. These proposals respond to long-standing local requests for safer, more inclusive streets.\nWhy this matters for Broomhill Although just beyond many residents‚Äô doorsteps, Thornwood Roundabout is a strategic junction for Broomhill trips‚Äîon foot, by bike, by bus, and by pram or wheelchair. In our Local Place Plan, the community called for better connections and safer crossings at the southern edge of our area. Upgrading this junction will help:\nReduce crossing risk and delay for pedestrians Improve step-free access for mobility-impaired users and families Create more coherent east‚Äìwest cycling links to the City Centre and the riverfront Make everyday trips (shops, school, transport interchanges) simpler and safer Collaboration so far This has been a collective effort involving Love Thornwood, Glasgow Eco Trust, and residents and Community Councils across Thornwood, Whiteinch, Jordanhill, Broomhill, and Scotstoun. A working group convened via the Victoria Park Area Partnership has helped secure funding and push these upgrades up the agenda. Now, it‚Äôs over to the wider community to shape the final design.\nüëè Thanks to our local Councillor We would like to extend a huge thank you to Councillor Lana Reid-McConnell, who has worked tirelessly over the past couple of years to convene partners, secure funding, and help drive these improvements forward through the Victoria Park Area Partnership. Her leadership in pulling together Community Councils, local groups and Council officers has been essential in getting the project to this consultation stage.\nYou can read more from Cllr. Reid-McConnell on her update page here:\nüëâ Thornwood Roundabout \u0026 Cycle Network Improvements\nhttps://open.substack.com/pub/lanareidmcconnell/p/thornwood-roundabout-and-cycle-network?utm_campaign=post\u0026utm_medium=web\nüé• Watch \u0026 learn Here‚Äôs a video that shows the new NCN7 Cyclelane on Castlebank Street and the Crossing Changes around the roundabout:\nüìÖ Drop-in event: Partick Library When: Thursday 15 November, 3:00‚Äì7:00 pm Where: Partick Library What: Walk-in public consultation with council officers; view plans, ask questions, and give feedback. ‚úÖ How to contribute Review the proposals \u0026 respond online: https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/thornwood Attend the Partick Library drop-in on 15 November to speak with officers.
