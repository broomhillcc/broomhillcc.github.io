<p>There have been a few incidents across the west end in recent months relating to cold callers as per the following scam.</p>
<h5 id="the-scam">The Scam<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-scam">#</a></h5>
<p>There has recently been an increase across Scotland in reports of cold callers who say they are selling goods door-to-door as part of an &rsquo;ex-offender rehabilitation scheme&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In some cases, the callers say they have just been released from prison or a young offenders institution and are selling goods to try and make some money before starting a college course. Others claim to be taking part in a Government scheme to help them obtain employment in sales.</p>
<p>They typically offer goods such as household cleaning products, gardening equipment or craft supplies. Some may ask for donations for ex-prisoners. If a householder does not have cash, the cold caller may provide bank account details so that they can transfer money.</p>
<p>Although some of these cold callers show some form of ID card, they often don&rsquo;t have a pedlar&rsquo;s certificate or a licence from the police to allow them to sell door-to-door in the local area. The goods they offer are usually of poor quality and overpriced.</p>
<h5 id="how-to-avoid">How to Avoid<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-avoid">#</a></h5>
<p>Never feel obliged to answer the door to a cold caller – it is your home and you should not let anyone in unless you feel comfortable.</p>
<p>If you do answer the door, verify that the person is genuine and take a note of the company’s details. ID cards can be faked – close the door and, rather than phoning the number on the ID card, look up the company’s number on their official website or in an official phone directory to check their identity. Legitimate callers will be happy to wait while you perform these checks.</p>
