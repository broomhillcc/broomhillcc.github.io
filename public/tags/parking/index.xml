&lt;p&gt;Please be advised that our Gullying Cleaning Programme is scheduled to take place in Broomhill/ Partick West &amp;amp; Drumchapel neighbourhood which will commence on Sunday 4th February 2024 weather permitting. The programme is due to last until 10th March 2024 and Glasgow City Council gullies within the area are due to be cleaned as part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&#34;do-you-park-a-vehicle-in-the-broomhillpartick-west--drumchapel-neighbourhoods&#34;&gt;Do you park a vehicle in the Broomhill/Partick West &amp;amp; Drumchapel Neighbourhoods&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll soon be in the area cleaning gullies, but for us to do our best, we need the streets to be clear of vehicles. This means 𝗻𝗼 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 your vehicle during the work. There will be temporary parking restrictions (TTRO) in your street and surrounding area 🚗️ ❌&lt;/p&gt;</description>
