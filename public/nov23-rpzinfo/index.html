Streets with excess parking spaces include Randolph Road East, Broomhill Drive West and East, Churchill Drive South, and others. Conclusion:\nWhile a small percentage of cars may need alternative parking, the overall report suggests that there will be ample excess capacity in Broomhill to accommodate parking needs, even after RPZ implementation.
