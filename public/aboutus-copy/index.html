We normally meet 10 times per year, and our chief role is representative: to consult the local community and to make known to the local authority and other public bodies the views of local people on all matters affecting them.\nAt our meetings we discuss local issues and areas of concern e.g. traffic problems, street cleaning, planning applications, licensing applications. We then work in partnership with our elected members, the local council or local police to resolve them.\nOur meetings are open to the public and regularly attended by our elected members as well as from time to time local police officers and other invited guests to speak on matters relevant to our area.\nCommunity councils form the most local tier of statutory representation in Scotland.
