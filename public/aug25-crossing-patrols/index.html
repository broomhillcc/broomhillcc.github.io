<p>Broomhill Community Council has received an update from Cllr Lana Reid-McConnell regarding the ongoing shortage of school crossing patrollers in our area.</p>
<p>Following concerns raised about the absence of patrollers at the busy junctions around Broomhill Primary, Cllr Reid-McConnell confirmed that Glasgow City Council is actively working to recruit staff for the vacant posts.</p>
<p>In the meantime, temporary arrangements have been put in place:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Woodcroft Road / Randolph Road:</strong> A patroller has been moved from another location to provide cover.</li>
<li><strong>Crow Road / Woodcroft Avenue:</strong> The school janitor, Tom, will be supporting this crossing point for the next few weeks until a permanent solution is found.</li>
</ul>
<p>The councillor explained that although the patrollers finished work before the summer break in June, their official retirement date fell at the start of the new term, which contributed to the gap in provision. Across the city, recruitment and sickness absences are putting pressure on the service, and the council is carrying out a wider review to improve resilience.</p>
<p>The school has been asked to remind parents and children about road safety during this period.</p>
<p>Anyone in the local community who may be interested in becoming a School Crossing Patroller is encouraged to apply. Application packs are available by emailing <strong><a href="mailto:CFMRecruitment@glasgow.gov.uk">CFMRecruitment@glasgow.gov.uk</a></strong> or via the <strong>MyJobScotland</strong> website.</p>
