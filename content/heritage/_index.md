## About Broomhill

Broomhill is the prettiest of the inner Glasgow dormitory suburbs and much of it is now a conservation area. Most of Broomhill was built between 1890 and 1950, with the earliest remaining building in 1855, though Balshagray in Broomhill was mentioned in the 1100’s. When the railway yards were sold off in the 1970's further more modern buildings were erected and in 2018 Broomhill Primary School was completely rebuilt.

This heritage trail lets you see Broomhill's proud past and vibrant future. I hope you enjoy your 3 mile stroll which should take you around 150 minutes including a visit to one of the many coffee shops in the area. The trail begins in Hyndland Rail Station Platform.
