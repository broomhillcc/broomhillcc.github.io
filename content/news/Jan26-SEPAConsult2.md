The Scottish Environment Protection Agency’s (SEPA) public consultation, launched on Wednesday 21st January, focuses on finding out about local flooding concerns in areas identified as having the highest flood risk. The feedback will help inform Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP) covering 2028 to 2034, which will set out how Scotland reduces the impacts of flooding and builds resilience for the future.
 
Flooding is already affecting communities across Scotland, and climate change is increasing the likelihood of heavier rainfall and more frequent storms. SEPA’s most recent National Flood Risk Assessment (2025) shows that around 400,000 homes, businesses and vital services, around one in eight across Scotland, are currently in areas at medium risk of flooding. This number is projected to rise to around 634,000 by 2100 as the climate continues to change.
 
The FRMP consultation builds on work carried out in 2024, when Potentially Vulnerable Areas were reviewed, and consulted on, to identify where highest flood risk is most likely now and in the future. These areas help focus attention and investment where flooding is most widespread or complex, and where partnership working is essential to reduce impacts.
 
The current consultation marks the next step in that process, focusing on gathering local insight to ensure future plans reflect lived experience. Running until 22nd April, it asks communities to share their main flooding concerns and highlight projects, initiatives or actions already helping to manage flood risk.
 
The aim is to help develop Flood Risk Management Plans that support resilient, well-informed communities, recognising the role of individuals, organisations and partnerships alongside national agencies and local authorities in adapting to a changing climate.
 
The consultation is part of a two-stage process. A second, more detailed consultation will begin from December 2026, when further information on flood risk, objectives and proposed actions will be published in partnership with local authorities. The final Flood Risk Management Plans are due to be published in December 2027.
