#### A new date for a much-loved local event!  

The **Spring Into Summer** community event is back — rescheduled for **Saturday 30 August, 12–4pm** in Victoria Park.  

Originally planned for June, the event had to be cancelled, but thanks to the hard work of organisers and partners it will now go ahead later this month.  

Organised by **Glasgow Eco Trust** and **Victoria Park Community Trust**, and kindly funded by **Whiteinch & Scotstoun Housing Association** and the **Glasgow 850 celebrations**, the day will feature a wide range of activities for all ages.  

🎉 Expect fun, family-friendly activities, community stalls, and a chance to connect with local groups and neighbours in the heart of our community.
