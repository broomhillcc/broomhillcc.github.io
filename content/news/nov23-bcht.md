##### Unveiling of Broomhill Hub Feasibility Study and Business Plan

Save the Date: Wednesday, 6th December

Time: 19:00 - 21:00

Venue: Broomhill Community Church, Norby Road

This gathering holds special significance as we will be unveiling the results of the feasibility study that many of you have been eagerly anticipating. The study marks a significant step forward in our community's initiatives and will shed light on the possibilities that lie ahead. The event will host a guest speaker Nikki Hesketh from SKS Scotland CIC, our consultants who will be on hand to speak to you about the results of the feasibility study and the business plan for the Broomhill Community Hub.

###### Updates on the Community right to buy process
In addition to sharing these exciting findings, we want to keep you updated on our progress with the Community Right to Buy application. As you may know, our case is currently before Ministers, and while the standard decision period is 30 days, it appears they are taking a bit longer given the nature of our late application. Rest assured, we are in touch with the Community Right to Buy team, and we will share any developments with you at the event.

Your presence and engagement are crucial to the success of our community initiatives, and we look forward to having you with us on this important evening.
