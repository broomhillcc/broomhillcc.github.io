##### Update

Bridge expansion joint replacements on the A898 Erskine Bridge northbound slip road, scheduled to take place over the weekend of Friday 17th November 2023, have been postponed due to forecast adverse weather. The successful delivery of all road maintenance schemes is subject to favourable weather conditions. Rescheduled dates will be communicated in due course. 


##### Notice

Amey, on behalf of Transport Scotland, are undertaking an essential bridge expansion joint replacement on the A898 northbound slip-road to the A82 westbound. Trial pit investigations will take place overnight on Thursday 2nd November until Friday 3rd November, between the hours of 10pm and 6am.  

The results of these investigations will inform the programme of expansion joint replacements, which are scheduled to be undertaken over a full weekend closure at this location from 8pm on Friday 17th November until 6am on Monday 20th November 2023. A signed diversion will be in operation. 

This scheme will benefit around 46,000 vehicles using this route each day, by improving the condition of the structure, and reducing the need for more extensive maintenance in the future. 

The diversion route is as follows: 

A898 northbound traffic, excluding HGVs, will be directed to take the A898 slip-road onto the A82 eastbound, and will turn left on to Mountblow Road. From here, traffic will take the next right turn towards Melbourne Avenue where they will be able to join the A82 westbound.   

HGV traffic will continue on the A82 eastbound to Kilbowie Roundabout and will take the fifth exit to join the A82 westbound.
