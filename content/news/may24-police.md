### Area Overview / General Information

There has been a noticeable decrease in crime over the month of May compared with April’s figures.

Over April there was a notable increase in Theft by Housebreakings in and around Randolph Rd/Rowallan Gardens and Thefts involving vehicles. The accused involved has been traced and arrested and since then there has been a significant reduction in crimes in the area. Over May there has been 1 vandalism, 1 Fraud and 1 Theft by Opening a Lockfast place. Both the Theft OLP and Vandalism involved vehicles and as always, I would urge anyone with a vehicle in the area to be mindful of locking and securing the vehicle and especially not to leave any items including bags etc in plain view.


#### Motorcycle Safety Campaign 2024

Our annual motorcycle safety campaign urges drivers to look out for motorcyclists as riders take to the road this summer.

The campaign runs from March to September, covering a period that sees the highest number of motorcyclists killed or seriously injured. Motorcyclists are one of the most vulnerable road users and are disproportionately represented in the number of people killed on Scotland’s roads.

In 2023/24, there were 151 road deaths and 27 were motorcyclists. Motorcyclists make up around one per cent of all road users yet account for 14 per cent of deaths.

Chief Superintendent Hilary Sloan, head of Road Policing, said: “We all have a responsibility to keep Scotland’s roads safe and motorcyclists are one of the most vulnerable road users.

“We know that most collisions involving a motorcyclist happen between March and September. You are more likely to see a motorcyclist on the road during this time and my message is look out for them, particularly at junctions and in rural areas.

“Failing to look properly or losing control can happen in a split second. Take responsibility and take care of each other on the road.”

Engagement and enforcement activity will take place throughout the spring and summer months using both marked and unmarked police vehicles.

Police Scotland officers, including those from the national motorcycle unit, will be carrying out intelligence led patrols to engage with all drivers and riders.

Content will be posted on our social media channels across summer to raise awareness of the campaign


#### Police Scotland Bank Scam

A  number of reports have been received by Police Scotland in regard to telephone calls from criminals impersonating police officers in order to obtain money from victims. The criminal impersonating the police informs the victim that they have been subject to a fraud, and thereafter the criminal will attempt to get money from the victim. Police Scotland officers will never:

1. Ask you to transfer money to another account
2. Ask you to withdraw money and hand it to a person or post it by mail
3. Exchange money into Euros or other foreign currency
4. Ask for your PIN number
5. Tell you that a new bank account has been set up for you to move money into

#### Theft of Keyless Entry Cars

Across the west end there continues to remain issues with theft of motor vehicles across the west end in general and I’d advise all residents in the area to be particularly careful about where their car keys are kept within their property, as vehicles have been targeted by persons breaking into properties to obtain the keys within the surrounding areas. I would strongly advise not to leave car keys within visible reach of letterbox’s or even within kitchens or other rooms on ground floor where they would be visible to someone looking in. As mentioned last month there continues to be issues with regards to the theft of vehicles that use keyless entry, mainly 4x4’s. Reports have seen vehicles taken overnight from both driveways and the street, where offenders are using relay devices whilst standing outside a property to manipulate the signal from the keycards that are inside, before gaining access to the vehicles and driving off without the need for any keys. By placing your keycard inside a “Faraday” pouch, this prevents the offenders from picking up a signal and bypassing the security of the vehicle. Faraday boxes are also beneficial if you have several keys within your property and wish to house them in a secure way. Both are readily available from a number of retailers online. 


#### 'Ex-offender' Cold Callers 

There have been a few incidents across the west end in recent months relating to cold callers as per the following scam.

##### The Scam
There has recently been an increase across Scotland in reports of cold callers who say they are selling goods door-to-door as part of an 'ex-offender rehabilitation scheme'. 

In some cases, the callers say they have just been released from prison or a young offenders institution and are selling goods to try and make some money before starting a college course. Others claim to be taking part in a Government scheme to help them obtain employment in sales.

They typically offer goods such as household cleaning products, gardening equipment or craft supplies. Some may ask for donations for ex-prisoners. If a householder does not have cash, the cold caller may provide bank account details so that they can transfer money.

Although some of these cold callers show some form of ID card, they often don't have a pedlar's certificate or a licence from the police to allow them to sell door-to-door in the local area. The goods they offer are usually of poor quality and overpriced.

##### How to Avoid
Never feel obliged to answer the door to a cold caller – it is your home and you should not let anyone in unless you feel comfortable.

If you do answer the door, verify that the person is genuine and take a note of the company’s details. ID cards can be faked – close the door and, rather than phoning the number on the ID card, look up the company’s number on their official website or in an official phone directory to check their identity. Legitimate callers will be happy to wait while you perform these checks.

If you feel uncomfortable or suspicious about a cold caller in your local area, phone Police Scotland on 101, or call 999 if you feel threatened.
