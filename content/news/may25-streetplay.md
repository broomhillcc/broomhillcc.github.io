#### Street Play 

Glasgow City Council are excited to share an incredible initiative that brings local communities together, Street Play! Run by Neighbourhoods Regeneration and Sustainability (NRS), Street Play allows communities to close local roads free-of-charge, creating a safe space where children can play outside, right near their homes.

By giving residents and local groups the opportunity to reclaim their streets, Street Play fosters a sense of community and provides a rare chance to enjoy a traffic-free environment. Itâ€™s open to residents as well as not-for-profit local organisations such as community groups, schools, and housing associations. 

The next available Street Play dates are: ðŸ“… 27-29 June 2025 (Apply by 13 June 2025) ðŸ“… 26-28 September 2025 (Apply by 12 September 2025)

If you're passionate about supporting safe, active communities, we'd love for your organisation to help spread the word and encourage participation.

Letâ€™s work together to make our streets safer and more vibrant!
