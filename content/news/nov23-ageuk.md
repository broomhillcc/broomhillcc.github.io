##### Age Scotlandâ€™s Friendship Service ðŸ˜Š
Over 50% of over 50s in Scotland say they feel lonely all or most of the time - Age Scotlandâ€™s Friendship Services aim to combat this!

The Friendship Service aims to reduce loneliness and isolation by providing friendship and companionship to older people via weekly phone calls. Our volunteers make these calls each week and have wonderful conversations, creating lovely relationships. We also have the Community Connecting service, which aims to connect older people to social opportunities in their local community.
