#### 🚦 Consultation live: safer walking, wheeling & cycling at Thornwood Roundabout

Glasgow City Council has opened a consultation on significant **active-travel improvements** at **Thornwood Roundabout** and a **new segregated cycle route**. While the roundabout sits at the **southern extent of the Broomhill Community Council area**, it is a **key gateway** for our residents and was highlighted in our **Local Place Plan** as important for everyday journeys.

### What’s proposed

- **Safer crossings:** Signalised crossings where feasible and **step-free, accessible crossings** on approaches from **Whiteinch, Broomhill, Thornwood, and Glasgow Harbour**.  
- **Bus stop safety on Dumbarton Road (Thornwood):** Designs prioritise **safe crossings between bus stops**.  
- **School routes:** **Step-free access at Auchentorlie Street and Thornwood Avenue**, improving safety on routes to **Thornwood Primary School**.  
- **National Cycle Network link:** A **segregated cycle lane** from the **Riverside Museum** to **Smith Street / Dilwara Street (Whiteinch)**, strengthening connections between West Glasgow, the City Centre, and the **Govan–Partick bridge**.

> We’ve been overdue improvements to walking, wheeling and cycling in this corridor. These proposals respond to long-standing local requests for safer, more inclusive streets.

### Why this matters for Broomhill

Although just beyond many residents’ doorsteps, Thornwood Roundabout is a **strategic junction** for Broomhill trips—on foot, by bike, by bus, and by pram or wheelchair. In our **Local Place Plan**, the community called for better connections and safer crossings at the **southern edge** of our area. Upgrading this junction will help:

- Reduce crossing risk and delay for pedestrians  
- Improve step-free access for mobility-impaired users and families  
- Create more **coherent east–west cycling links** to the City Centre and the riverfront  
- Make everyday trips (shops, school, transport interchanges) **simpler and safer**

### Collaboration so far

This has been a **collective effort** involving **Love Thornwood**, **Glasgow Eco Trust**, and residents and **Community Councils** across **Thornwood, Whiteinch, Jordanhill, Broomhill, and Scotstoun**. A working group convened via the **Victoria Park Area Partnership** has helped secure funding and push these upgrades up the agenda. Now, it’s over to the wider community to shape the final design.
