#### üö¶ Consultation live: safer walking, wheeling & cycling at Thornwood Roundabout

Glasgow City Council has opened a consultation on significant **active-travel improvements** at **Thornwood Roundabout** and a **new segregated cycle route**. While the roundabout sits at the **southern extent of the Broomhill Community Council area**, it is a **key gateway** for our residents and was highlighted in our **Local Place Plan** as important for everyday journeys.

### What‚Äôs proposed

- **Safer crossings:** Signalised crossings where feasible and **step-free, accessible crossings** on approaches from **Whiteinch, Broomhill, Thornwood, and Glasgow Harbour**.  
- **Bus stop safety on Dumbarton Road (Thornwood):** Designs prioritise **safe crossings between bus stops**.  
- **School routes:** **Step-free access at Auchentorlie Street and Thornwood Avenue**, improving safety on routes to **Thornwood Primary School**.  
- **National Cycle Network link:** A **segregated cycle lane** from the **Riverside Museum** to **Smith Street / Dilwara Street (Whiteinch)**, strengthening connections between West Glasgow, the City Centre, and the **Govan‚ÄìPartick bridge**.

> We‚Äôve been overdue improvements to walking, wheeling and cycling in this corridor. These proposals respond to long-standing local requests for safer, more inclusive streets.

### Why this matters for Broomhill

Although just beyond many residents‚Äô doorsteps, Thornwood Roundabout is a **strategic junction** for Broomhill trips‚Äîon foot, by bike, by bus, and by pram or wheelchair. In our **Local Place Plan**, the community called for better connections and safer crossings at the **southern edge** of our area. Upgrading this junction will help:

- Reduce crossing risk and delay for pedestrians  
- Improve step-free access for mobility-impaired users and families  
- Create more **coherent east‚Äìwest cycling links** to the City Centre and the riverfront  
- Make everyday trips (shops, school, transport interchanges) **simpler and safer**

### Collaboration so far

This has been a **collective effort** involving **Love Thornwood**, **Glasgow Eco Trust**, and residents and **Community Councils** across **Thornwood, Whiteinch, Jordanhill, Broomhill, and Scotstoun**. A working group convened via the **Victoria Park Area Partnership** has helped secure funding and push these upgrades up the agenda. Now, it‚Äôs over to the wider community to shape the final design.

### üëè Thanks to our local Councillor

We would like to extend a **huge thank you to Councillor Lana Reid-McConnell**, who has worked tirelessly over the past couple of years to convene partners, secure funding, and help drive these improvements forward through the Victoria Park Area Partnership. Her leadership in pulling together Community Councils, local groups and Council officers has been essential in getting the project to this consultation stage.
