#### 🚗🚶‍♂️ New Traffic Regulations Coming to Glasgow! 🚶‍♂️🚗

Glasgow City Council has announced upcoming changes to traffic enforcement that will impact how we use our city’s streets. These changes, empowered by the Scottish Government, aim to enhance road safety and accessibility for all.

##### 🔍 What's Changing?
Starting from December 2023, local authorities have been given the authority to enforce against specific road offences to ensure safer and more accessible streets. The focus will be on:

- **Parking on Pavements**
- **Double Parking**
- **Parking at Dropped Kerb Crossing Points**

These measures are crucial for keeping footpaths clear for pedestrians and ensuring emergency services can navigate the city without obstructions.

##### 👀 Why This Matters
The enforcement of these offences is part of Glasgow City Council's commitment to maintaining order and safety on our roads. It's important for all of us to understand and adhere to these new regulations to contribute to a safer community.

##### 📖 Dive Deeper
For more information on what these new prohibitions entail and how they affect you, please visit our [Pavement Parking Prohibitions FAQs](https://glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=30597).

##### 🚧 Apply for a Pavement Parking Exemption
Certain streets may qualify for an exemption from the pavement parking ban if they meet specific criteria, such as:

- Insufficient carriageway width for emergency vehicles when vehicles are parked fully on the carriageway.
- The footway must be wide enough to accommodate the parked vehicle and still provide at least 1.5 metres of unobstructed space for pedestrian use.

To see if your street qualifies and to apply for an exemption, visit [Pavement Parking Exemption Form](https://glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=30582).

##### 📌 Note:
Please be aware that applying for an exemption does not guarantee approval, as each request undergoes a thorough assessment process.
