##### Gully Cleaning Programme Broomhill/Partick West & Drumchapel 04/02-10/03
Please be advised that our Gullying Cleaning Programme is scheduled to take place in Broomhill/ Partick West & Drumchapel neighbourhood which will commence on Sunday 4th February 2024 weather permitting. The programme is due to last until 10th March 2024 and Glasgow City Council gullies within the area are due to be cleaned as part of this.

###### Do you park a vehicle in the Broomhill/Partick West & Drumchapel Neighbourhoods

We’ll soon be in the area cleaning gullies, but for us to do our best, we need the streets to be clear of vehicles. This means 𝗻𝗼 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 your vehicle during the work. There will be temporary parking restrictions (TTRO) in your street and surrounding area 🚗️ ❌

###### 𝗪𝗵𝗲𝗻  𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?

🗓 Work is due to start Sunday 4th February 2024 weather permitting. Signage will be on placed on the streets that are due to be cleaned. Please move your car to another location until the works are completed.

##### 𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗧𝗧𝗥𝗢?

A Temporary Traffic Restriction Order (TTRO) allows The Council to add and/or change a restriction on a road on a temporary basis to allow work to be completed, where required. In this instance, we need to use a TTRO to allow the teams access to carry out this essential work.

This means parking restrictions and road closures to allow for gully cleaning. If you don’t move your vehicle in line with the temporary restrictions, it will be uplifted and moved to another location, and could result in a penalty charge notice 💸

The TTRO will be in place for the duration of the work – this means 𝗻𝗼 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲. There will be clear street signage and yellow cones where parking restrictions apply. You can still drive by and drop off/pick up.

To get the best results for your street, we need you to move your vehicle and comply with the TTRO. Look out for the signage on your street. We appreciate your help and thank you for helping us #CleanGlasgow 😍
