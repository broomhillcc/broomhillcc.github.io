##### Notice

Amey, on behalf of Transport Scotland, are undertaking essential woodland maintenance on the M77 between Junctions 5 and 2 from Monday 13th November 2023 until Tuesday 16th January 2024. The works will pause for the Christmas break between Friday 22nd December 2023 and Thursday 4th January 2024. 

This scheme will benefit around 13,000 vehicles using this route each day, by removing hazardous trees in close proximity to the trunk road, as well as increasing the resilience of the landscape in the face of pests, diseases, and climate change. 

All operations on the mainline and the slip roads will be during daylight hours with hard shoulder closures. Except at Junction 4 and 3 on slips, where operations will be during nighttime hours with both on slip roads closed. The two slip road closure dates will be confirmed and communicated in a future news release with diversion routes. 

Access for emergency service vehicles will be maintained throughout these works.
