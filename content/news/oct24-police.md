### Area Overview / General Information
Over October there has been a slight increase in crime reports compared with September’s figures.

Notably there has been 2 reports of theft from motor vehicles, involving the theft of sports equipment from an insecure vehicle and a theft of motorbike which was found nearby.

I would request that residents in the area are mindful of ensuring their vehicles are not only locked and secured, but also that no items of any value are left on show, especially bags, or sports equipment such as golf clubs. In nearby Hyndland there had been a spate of thefts from motor vehicles involving golf clubs over the last few months. Road Traffic incidents were also up with detections at Balshagray Avenue and Crow Rd, involving vehicles with no insurance, MOT and not displaying registration plates. 

We also attended Broomhill Primary earlier this month to discuss the role of Police, where they had the opportunity to ask questions and were given a tour our police vehicle and sirens! We also managed to hand out high-visibility stickers and bike equipment packs to keep them safe on their walk to school and books were also handed out.

With crime increasing dramatically within the retail industry, it’s not only a burden on your business in relation to profit margins but can adversely affect the general day to day running.

#### Theft of Keyless Entry Cars

Across the west end there continues to remain issues with theft of motor vehicles in general and I’d advise all residents in the area to be particularly careful about where their car keys are kept within their property, as vehicles have been targeted by persons breaking into properties to obtain the keys within the surrounding areas. I would strongly advise not to leave car keys within visible reach of letterbox’s or even within kitchens or other rooms on ground floor where they would be visible to someone looking in. As mentioned last month there continues to be issues with regards to the theft of vehicles that use keyless entry, mainly 4x4’s. Reports have seen vehicles taken overnight from both driveways and the street, where offenders are using relay devices whilst standing outside a property to manipulate the signal from the keycards that are inside, before gaining access to the vehicles and driving off without the need for any keys. By placing your keycard inside a “Faraday” pouch, this prevents the offenders from picking up a signal and bypassing the security of the vehicle. Faraday boxes are also beneficial if you have several keys within your property and wish to house them in a secure way. Both are readily available from a number of retailers online. 


#### 'Ex-offender' Cold Callers 

There have been a few incidents across the west end in recent months relating to cold callers as per the following scam.

##### The Scam
There has recently been an increase across Scotland in reports of cold callers who say they are selling goods door-to-door as part of an 'ex-offender rehabilitation scheme'. 

In some cases, the callers say they have just been released from prison or a young offenders institution and are selling goods to try and make some money before starting a college course. Others claim to be taking part in a Government scheme to help them obtain employment in sales.

They typically offer goods such as household cleaning products, gardening equipment or craft supplies. Some may ask for donations for ex-prisoners. If a householder does not have cash, the cold caller may provide bank account details so that they can transfer money.

Although some of these cold callers show some form of ID card, they often don't have a pedlar's certificate or a licence from the police to allow them to sell door-to-door in the local area. The goods they offer are usually of poor quality and overpriced.

##### How to Avoid
Never feel obliged to answer the door to a cold caller – it is your home and you should not let anyone in unless you feel comfortable.

If you do answer the door, verify that the person is genuine and take a note of the company’s details. ID cards can be faked – close the door and, rather than phoning the number on the ID card, look up the company’s number on their official website or in an official phone directory to check their identity. Legitimate callers will be happy to wait while you perform these checks.

If you feel uncomfortable or suspicious about a cold caller in your local area, phone Police Scotland on 101, or call 999 if you feel threatened.
