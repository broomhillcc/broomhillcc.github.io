### Area Overview / General Information

Over January, crime reports have increased compared with December’s figures.

There has also been a notable increase in acquisitive crimes in the area, notably theft by housebreaking within commercial premises. One
nominal has now been traced in relation to 2 x Theft by Housebreaking and charged accordingly.


#### Theft of Keyless Entry Cars

There continues to remain issues with theft of motor vehicles, not only in Broomhill but across the west end in general and I'd advise all
residents in the area to be particularly careful about where their car keys are kept within their property, as vehicles have been targeted by
persons breaking into properties to obtain the keys within the Hyndland area. I would strongly advise not to leave car keys within
visible reach of letterbox’s or even within kitchens or other rooms on ground floor where they would be visible to someone looking in.
As mentioned last month there continues to be issues with regards to the theft of vehicles that use keyless entry, mainly 4x4’s, with 1 report
in Broomhill again this month. Reports have seen vehicles taken overnight from both driveways and the street, where offenders are
using relay devices whilst standing outside a property to manipulate the signal from the keycards that are inside, before gaining access to
the vehicles and driving off without the need for any keys. By placing your keycard inside a “Faraday” pouch, this prevents the offenders from picking up a signal and bypassing the security of the vehicle. Faraday boxes are also beneficial if you have several keys within your property and wish to house them in a secure way. Both are readily available from a number of retailers online.

#### 'Ex-offender' Cold Callers 

There have been a few incidents across the west end in recent months relating to cold callers as per the following scam.

##### The Scam
There has recently been an increase across Scotland in reports of cold callers who say they are selling goods door-to-door as part of an 'ex-offender rehabilitation scheme'. 

In some cases, the callers say they have just been released from prison or a young offenders institution and are selling goods to try and make some money before starting a college course. Others claim to be taking part in a Government scheme to help them obtain employment in sales.

They typically offer goods such as household cleaning products, gardening equipment or craft supplies. Some may ask for donations for ex-prisoners. If a householder does not have cash, the cold caller may provide bank account details so that they can transfer money.

Although some of these cold callers show some form of ID card, they often don't have a pedlar's certificate or a licence from the police to allow them to sell door-to-door in the local area. The goods they offer are usually of poor quality and overpriced.
##### How to Avoid
Never feel obliged to answer the door to a cold caller – it is your home and you should not let anyone in unless you feel comfortable.

If you do answer the door, verify that the person is genuine and take a note of the company’s details. ID cards can be faked – close the door and, rather than phoning the number on the ID card, look up the company’s number on their official website or in an official phone directory to check their identity. Legitimate callers will be happy to wait while you perform these checks.

If you feel uncomfortable or suspicious about a cold caller in your local area, phone Police Scotland on 101, or call 999 if you feel threatened.
