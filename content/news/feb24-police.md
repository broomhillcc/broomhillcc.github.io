### Area Overview / General Information

Over February, crime reports have seen a welcome decrease compared with Januarys figures. Housebreakings and property related crime increased last month with commercial properties in the surrounding areas having been targeted, however February has seen no reports of housebreakings or crimes against property within the Broomhill area. 

I would however encourage persons with commercial properties in Broomhill to remain vigilant and ensure that all security measures are taken to prevent and deter persons from targeting premises with cash kept to a minimum within till floats and no other major items of value left within premises if possible, for example IPads etc. 

We have seen a rise in youth disorder across the west end, in particular within Partick around Merkland Court and West End Retail Park. Shoplifting amongst these groups continues to remain an issue and we have identified a number of persons involved. 

Hyndland Train station has also seen a rise in anti-social behaviour, and I would encourage local residents to report incidents of youths causing anti-social behaviour to police via 101 for non-emergencies and 999 for ongoing disturbances. I would also encourage anyone with a secure entry system to ensure that it is in working order and not to allow any persons in who are not obviously linked to the block as we have seen youths entering common close areas and antagonising homeowners.  Police have been in the area engaging with these groups and dispersing them accordingly.


#### Theft of Keyless Entry Cars

As mentioned last month there continues to be issues with regards to the theft of vehicles that use keyless entry, mainly 4x4’s, with 1 report in Broomhill again this month. Reports have seen vehicles taken overnight from both driveways and the street, where offenders are using relay devices whilst standing outside a property to manipulate the signal from the keycards that are inside, before gaining access to the vehicles and driving off without the need for any keys. By placing your keycard inside a “Faraday” pouch, this prevents the offenders from picking up a signal and bypassing the security of the vehicle. Faraday boxes are also beneficial if you have several keys within your property and wish to house them in a secure way. Both are readily available from a number of retailers online. 


#### 'Ex-offender' Cold Callers 

There have been a few incidents across the west end in recent months relating to cold callers as per the following scam.

##### The Scam
There has recently been an increase across Scotland in reports of cold callers who say they are selling goods door-to-door as part of an 'ex-offender rehabilitation scheme'. 

In some cases, the callers say they have just been released from prison or a young offenders institution and are selling goods to try and make some money before starting a college course. Others claim to be taking part in a Government scheme to help them obtain employment in sales.

They typically offer goods such as household cleaning products, gardening equipment or craft supplies. Some may ask for donations for ex-prisoners. If a householder does not have cash, the cold caller may provide bank account details so that they can transfer money.

Although some of these cold callers show some form of ID card, they often don't have a pedlar's certificate or a licence from the police to allow them to sell door-to-door in the local area. The goods they offer are usually of poor quality and overpriced.

##### How to Avoid
Never feel obliged to answer the door to a cold caller – it is your home and you should not let anyone in unless you feel comfortable.

If you do answer the door, verify that the person is genuine and take a note of the company’s details. ID cards can be faked – close the door and, rather than phoning the number on the ID card, look up the company’s number on their official website or in an official phone directory to check their identity. Legitimate callers will be happy to wait while you perform these checks.

If you feel uncomfortable or suspicious about a cold caller in your local area, phone Police Scotland on 101, or call 999 if you feel threatened.
