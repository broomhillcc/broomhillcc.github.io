##### Let's Be Heard: Sharing Scotland's COVID Experience is the Scottish COVID-19 Inquiry's listening project


Everyone who was in Scotland between 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022, or was affected by decisions made in Scotland during this time, is being invited to share their experiences of the pandemic with Let's Be Heard. The project is keen to hear about what lessons should be learned and is asking for experiences to be submitted by 20 December 2023.
