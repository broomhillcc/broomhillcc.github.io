## Privacy Policy
##### Who we are
Broomhill Community Council was first established under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. Thereafter, the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994, which produced the current system of unitary local authorities, made the provision for the continuation of community councils.

##### How your personal information helps us to fulfil our General Purpose
By providing us with your contact details, you can help us “to ascertain, co-ordinate and express to the local authorities for its area, and to public authorities, the views of the community which it represents, in relation to matters for which those authorities are responsible, and to take such action in the interests of that community as appears to it to be expedient and practicable.” (Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 section 51, 2)

We may also use your information to verify your identity where deemed appropriate, contact you by email and to maintain our records.

When you register to attend a Community Council meeting, your name and email address will be recorded. Your email address is required to allow us to send your registration confirmation and meeting details. If the meeting is held online , your registration information will be stored on the servers used by our online service provider (details below). Your name is recorded to ensure that only registered people attend the meeting.

##### How we store your data
Your data is stored electronically. We may make use of external services to provide services to subscribers and registered members. We adhere to their privacy policies, which you can view by clicking on the service name. We currently use the following services:

| PURPOSE | SERVICE  |
|-----------|--------- |
|File Storage| [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) |
|Internal communications| [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/trust/privacy/privacy-policy) |

Our website is hosted by GithubPages. Their servers are located world wide and mirrored in the UK. None of your data is stored on our page

##### Legislative basis for using your information
We aim to fulfil our General purpose as part of our statutory function as your local Community Council. You can find more details of our role at 
[glasgow.gov.uk/communitycouncils](glasgow.gov.uk/communitycouncils)

##### What might we do with your information?
We will not share your personal information with any third parties unless we secure your full permission to do so in the first instance. Information may be analysed internally to help us to reach all communities within our boundary area. It could also help us to improve our engagement and representation of the whole community.

We will normally keep your personal information for the purposes it was collated for. The Scottish Council on Archives (in their capacity as an advisory body on local authority records management) does not specify a retention period for Community Councils, although it is considered appropriate for any records to be reviewed and/or confidentially deleted at the end of the Community Council’s 4-yearly cycle, or sooner should the Community Council decide to do so.
