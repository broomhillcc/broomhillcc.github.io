## Statement to Broomhill Community

Broomhill Community Council (BCC) has concerns about the Restricted  
Parking Zone (RPZ) proposed for Broomhill.  
BCC has previously submitted design plan feedback to Glasgow City  
Council (GCC) in 2024, some of which has been taken into account in  
the design plans. Having now had opportunity to consider the likely impact of the proposed  
RPZ, BCC cannot support the current proposals for the Broomhill area.

For the purposes of this response, BCC has restricted comment to headline issues likely to be  
relevant to the whole community. We are aware this is not a comprehensive list of specific  
comments or concerns from residents in Broomhill and encourage all residents to provide  
feedback to the ongoing community engagement survey and to our elected councillors.

## BCC response to GCC regarding the proposed RPZ

Broomhill is a quiet residential area with a thriving primary school and a small number of  
independent businesses. Although bus and train links exist in the vicinity, these are not  
comparable to a city centre location, while available cycling infrastructure is mixed. As such,  
the current proposals for restricted parking will deter or restrict visitors to the area. As a  
predominantly residential area, we are concerned about the isolating effect this will have on  
residents of Broomhill, many of whom are elderly or have young families. The parking  
restrictions will apply to those providing essential support networks to Broomhill residents:  
both formally (e.g. paid carers) and informally (unpaid carers, family and friends, charities.)  
Older adults, young families and residents with health and/or mobility issues will be  
particularly vulnerable to restrictions on car parking. Glasgow City Council’s Family Equality  
Outcomes Action Plan 2025-2030 recognises loneliness as a priority issue. In addition, the  
restrictions will impact many groups which meet in the area; we specifically note the parking  
restrictions will apply to staff at Broomhill Primary School, potentially undermining the  
essential work of Educational Services in Broomhill.

With these concerns, we would expect GCC to take a least-restrictive approach to the  
implementation of parking restrictions. However, the proposed charges and operational times  
for the Broomhill RPZ exceed what is justifiable for Broomhill and appear more suited to a city  
centre area.

We are aware that GCC Parking Services recently developed two standardised options for  
parking zones in Glasgow City. While a move to Option B\* for the Broomhill RPZ would clearly  
be better suited to the area, this would still involve parking restrictions until 6pm and on  
Saturdays. The 3-hour maximum parking limit and proposed fee structure would also remain  
unchanged. We consider Option B to remain excessive for the Broomhill area. If the intended  
purpose of the RPZ (for non-residents of the area) is to encourage use of alternative transport  
modes for commuters and work-related activities, this can be achieved with shorter daytime  
operational hours, Monday to Friday only, and without the 3-hour maximum stay. We also  
understand the statutory power to charge for parking provided to GCC by the Road Traffic  
Regulation Act 1984 is lawful when used primarily to address issues like traffic congestion, not  
to raise revenue. We invite GCC to provide evidence that parking restrictions are justified by  
congestion concerns in Broomhill during evening and weekend times, or to amend the  
proposed operational times and limits to appropriately suit the Broomhill area.

Specifically, regarding resident’s visitor parking permits: we request GCC provides clearer  
clarification that these are available for purchase without limitations. As it stands, GCC intends  
to reserve the theoretical right to deny sale of visitor permits to residents. This is  
extraordinary power to claim over the lives of Broomhill residents, and it is remarkable that  
GCC has not recognised the seriousness of this. GCC must provide reassurance by explicitly  
detailing what circumstances could lead to denial of visitor permits, who this decision would  
reside with, and what route to appeal would exist.

We encourage GCC to ensure that the proposed RPZ does not undermine the work and  
priorities of other GCC departments. BCC is concerned that implementation of this RPZ is  
proposed despite a lack of available information regarding GCC’s overall parking strategy.  
There is little evidence that this RPZ has been proposed with a holistic view of our community  
and the people who live and work here. Without clearer evidence that the RPZ will bring  
overall benefit to the Broomhill area as a whole (as opposed to a narrow focus on parking  
issues, many of which GCC can address through existing regulations), BCC cannot support the  
current proposals for an RPZ in Broomhill.

\* Parking Services Update to GCC, 25th November 2025, proposes two standardised options as  
follows: Option A Mon – Sun 8am – 10pm and Option B Mon – Sat 8am – 6pm.
