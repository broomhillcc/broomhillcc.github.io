Now the survey has closed, BCC are looking at the next stage of the RPZ process and how it affects Broomhill. 

As per BCC ‘s statement on the RPZ, we have serious questions about the legal basis by which GCC are proceeding with a submission for a Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) - especially if it is for 7 days a week, 8am-10pm. 

Accordingly, we are seeking a legal opinion to inform an official objection during the statutory TRO consultation period.  

We plan to instruct a solicitor who can then instruct an Advocate: to review the information provided by GCC, and to prepare a formal legal opinion on the basis of GCC’s proposals.

BCC needs to raise up to £5000 for this next step.  

If you agree with BCC’s position and wish to support this objection, could you please email BroomhillCC01@gmail.com with what you would like to pledge.  

We will keep this information confidential and will not disclose individual donation amounts.  There is no obligation or expectation for you to donate, as we fully appreciate the wider economic conditions. We will not be requesting money from anyone unless we have enough pledged to proceed. 

We think a legal opinion is worth exploring as once a TRO is introduced future legal options to challenge an RPZ would start from £20k. 

We must be clear that there is no guarantee that this will prevent, or limit, what GCC might ultimately introduce.

To assist this process, BCC has submitted a number of requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act.  If the legal opinion option goes ahead, this information would be provided to the Advocate for review.  If you have also submitted any FOI requests, and you are comfortable in doing so, please share any FOI responses with us.

If you have individual concerns on the proposals, we recommend that you consider taking your own independent legal advice.
