summary: "Next Steps - Pursuing a Legal Opinion on the RPZ"

---
Now the survey has closed, BCC are looking at the next stage of the RPZ process and how it affects Broomhill. 

As per BCC ‘s statement on the RPZ, we have serious questions about the legal basis by which GCC are proceeding with a submission for a Traffic Regulation Order (TRO) - especially if it is for 7 days a week, 8am-10pm. 

Accordingly, we are seeking a legal opinion to inform an official objection during the statutory TRO consultation period.  

We plan to instruct a solicitor who can then instruct an Advocate: to review the information provided by GCC, and to prepare a formal legal opinion on the basis of GCC’s proposals.

BCC needs to raise up to £5000 for this next step.  

If you agree with BCC’s position and wish to support this objection, could you please email BroomhillCC01@gmail.com with what you would like to pledge.  

We will keep this information confidential and will not disclose individual donation amounts.  There is no obligation or expectation for you to donate, as we fully appreciate the wider economic conditions. We will not be requesting money from anyone unless we have enough pledged to proceed. 

We think a legal opinion is worth exploring as once a TRO is introduced future legal options to challenge an RPZ would start from £20k. 

We must be clear that there is no guarantee that this will prevent, or limit, what GCC might ultimately introduce.

To assist this process, BCC has submitted a number of requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act.  If the legal opinion option goes ahead, this information would be provided to the Advocate for review.  If you have also submitted any FOI requests, and you are comfortable in doing so, please share any FOI responses with us.

All monies received will be directed to legal advice regarding the RPZ.

If you have individual concerns on the proposals, we recommend that you consider taking your own independent legal advice.

Frequently Asked Questions:
Will you be joining with other Community Councils in Glasgow?
We are in communication with our neighbouring CC's as our communities do co-exist. This legal opinion is for the Broomhill and Thornwood TRO and the particular issues we face. 

Can other areas share the cost? 
While we can accept pledges from anywhere, we must be clear that it is fund a specific legal query relating to the Broomhill and Thornwood RPZ and the particular issues we face. 

What if you receive more pledges than required? 
After funding the Legal Opinion, there are additional areas we have considered seeking legal advice. The first of these would be around GCC's Equalty Impact Assessment that is due to be done on this TRO. We would be seeking advice on indirect discrimination if the EQIA is not done to a high standard.

BCC is a voluntary group of residents undertaking this additional work. We do appreciate there are many ideas being suggested for BCC to undertake, but these do have to be matched with the available voluntary resources to deliver them. We are encouraged by the support and help offered by residents and neighbouring CC's. If any resident wishes to find out more how they can volunteer as part of BCC, advocating for our community, please do get in touch BroomhillCC01gmail.com or speak to a member of BCC at our next meeting which will be on 11th February.
